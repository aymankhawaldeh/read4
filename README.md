When making sense of a design, we tend to organize visual elements
into groups. Grouping related pieces of information together can make a
design easier to comprehend. Here are some ways this can be achieved.
grouping and
Similarity
Proximity
When several items are
placed close together, they are
perceived as more related than
items that are placed further
apart. (You can also nest groups
of information within larger
groups of information.)
Closure
When faced with a complicated
arrangement of items, we
will often look for a single or
recognisable pattern or form.
A real or imaginary box can be
formed around elements due to
their proximity and alignment.
Continuance
When elements are placed in
a line or a curve then they are
perceived to be more related
than those that are not following
the same direction. This can be
used to direct a reader from one
part of a page to the next.
White Space
Placing related items closer
together and leaving a bigger
gap between unrelated items.
color
A background color placed
behind related items to
emphasize their connection.
Borders
A line can be drawn around the
border of the group or between it
and its neighbors.

and elements can be used for: ● The main header or footer that appears at the top or bottom of every page on the site. ● A header or footer for an individual or within the page. In this example, the element used to contain the site name and the main navigation. The element contains copyright information, along with links to the privacy policy and terms and conditions. Each individual and element can also have its own and elements to hold the header or footer information for that section within the page. For example, on a page with several blog posts, each individual post can be thought of as a separate section. The element can therefore be used to contain the title and date of each individual post, and the might contain links to share the article on social networking sites
